Every tweet has associated with it 33 discrete data points. There is, of course, the tweet itself, but most of those data points are actually pretty worthless when you scale them: user's wallpaper and avatar, even a user's name doesn't mean anything in aggregate.

For users who have it turned on (and I imagine a majority do), Twitter tracks the longitude and latitude from where the tweet was posted.
